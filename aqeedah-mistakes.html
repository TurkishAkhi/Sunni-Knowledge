    <p>
      Many mistakes in belief happen due to culture, ignorance, or good intentions
      without correct knowledge. This page aims to clarify these issues gently and
      according to the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MISTAKE 1 -->
  <section class="box warning">
    <h3>❌ Making duʿāʾ to other than Allah</h3>

    <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Calling upon prophets, saints, graves, or righteous people.</p>

    <p><strong>Why people fall into it:</strong> They believe these people are closer to Allah and can act as intermediaries.</p>

    <p><strong>Correct belief:</strong> Duʿāʾ is an act of worship, and worship is for Allah alone.</p>

    <p class="evidence">
      <strong>Evidence:</strong> “And the mosques are for Allah, so do not invoke anyone along with Allah.”
      (Qur’an 72:18)
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MISTAKE 2 -->
  <section class="box warning">
    <h3>❌ Saying “Bidʿah is okay if the intention is good”</h3>

    <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Believing good intentions make an act of worship acceptable.</p>

    <p><strong>Why people fall into it:</strong> They confuse sincerity with correctness.</p>

    <p><strong>Correct belief:</strong> Worship must be sincere <em>and</em> in accordance with the Sunnah.</p>

    <p class="evidence">
      <strong>Evidence:</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said:
      “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours that which is not from it, it is rejected.”
      (Bukhārī & Muslim)
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MISTAKE 3 -->
  <section class="box warning">
    <h3>❌ Denying or explaining away Allah’s attributes</h3>

    <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Claiming Allah’s attributes are only metaphors without evidence.</p>

    <p><strong>Why people fall into it:</strong> Fear of likening Allah to His creation.</p>

    <p><strong>Correct belief:</strong> We affirm what Allah affirmed for Himself without asking how.</p>

    <p class="evidence">
      <strong>Evidence:</strong> “There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.”
      (Qur’an 42:11)
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MISTAKE 4 -->
  <section class="box warning">
    <h3>❌ Blindly following culture or people against evidence</h3>

    <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Accepting beliefs just because family or community practices them.</p>

    <p><strong>Why people fall into it:</strong> Fear of questioning tradition.</p>

    <p><strong>Correct belief:</strong> We respect scholars but follow the Qur’an and Sunnah.</p>

    <p class="evidence">
      <strong>Evidence:</strong> “And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger.”
      (Qur’an 4:59)
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONCLUSION -->
  <section class="box info">
    <p>
      Correcting belief is not about attacking people, but about seeking the truth
      and worshipping Allah as He commanded.
